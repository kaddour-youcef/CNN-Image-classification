# CNN-Image-classification
Image classification using a KERAS Based CNN 
---------------------------------------------------

In this example i'm using two classes of training images, the first classe is "HORSE" and a=the seconde is "COW".
the files are stored in a google drive in this forme :

- the training data :  train_data_path = 'gdrive/My Drive/Colab-Notebooks/Newdata/Train'
containing the following files : 
Horse/horse00.jpg --- to --- horse20.jpg
Cow/Cow00.jpg --- to --- Cow20.jpg

same for the : 
- the validation data : validation_data_path = 'gdrive/My Drive/Colab-Notebooks/Newdata/Test' 
containing the following files : 
Horse/horse00.jpg --- to --- horse20.jpg
Cow/Cow00.jpg --- to --- Cow20.jpg

feel free to change the code for the classification of other objects.
